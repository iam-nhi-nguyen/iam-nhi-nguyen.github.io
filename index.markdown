## About Me

Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science at NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, 
working on explainable machine learning, interpretable machine learning,
and machine learning for healthcare, advised by 
Professor [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/) and
Professor [Oded Regev](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/). 
I'm grateful to be a [DeepMind Scholar](https://deepmind.google/about/education/). 

I graduated from Yale University with a combined MS in Computer Science and a BS in
Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. As an undergraduate student, I had the pleasure to work 
with Professor [Smita Krishnaswamy](https://krishnaswamylab.org/) and 
Professor [David van Dijk](https://www.vandijklab.org/) on projects investigating the use of
graph neural networks on analyzing sequencing data.
